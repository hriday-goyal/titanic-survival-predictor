# ðŸš¢ Titanic Survival Predictor
A machine learning project built for Kaggleâ€™s 'Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster' competition to predict passenger survival chances based on various factors.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
The model uses logistic regression and preprocessing techniques to analyze survival outcomes based on passenger data such as age, gender, class, and family onboard.

### ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
- Python
- scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib

## ðŸš€ Features
- Cleaned and processed dataset (handling nulls, encoding)
- Logistic Regression Model
- Achieved 76.3% prediction accuracy
- Data visualization and correlation analysis

## ðŸ§ª ML Techniques
- Logistic Regression
- One-hot encoding
- Feature engineering
